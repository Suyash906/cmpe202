## Lab 9 - Java Lambda Lab

- I have implemented Strategy pattern using Lambda expressions.
- I have used converted the Lab 6 - Five Guys Burger code to labmba.
- With lambda implementation, we have reduced the number of classes. Lambda allows to pass methods as arguments provided it is compatible with the functional interface.
- In the codebase PrintOrderStrategy.java defines the function interface. The recepit and packing bill info has been implemented as Java lambda block expression.
